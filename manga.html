  <h3><span style="color: #00ccff;">I recommend Solo Leveling but that was done on a previous website so it wont be reviewed on here.</span></h3>
  <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #00ccff;">Hero? I Quit a Long Time Ago...</span></h2>
  <h3><span style="color: #00ccff;">Overall rating: 9.5/10 </span></h3>

  <p><span style="color: #00ccff;">Zero was mankind's first real superhero. Under his watch, countless other superheroes appeared and followed in his footsteps. However, after 5 years of war, Zero dissapeared without a trace. <strong>Art:</strong> 9.5/10 the art in "Hero? I Quit a Long Time Ago..." is very well done in the fact that it is well drawn, fully colored, and has no blank backgrounds. <strong>Plot:</strong> 9.5/10 The plot in "Hero? I Quit a Long Time Ago..." is pretty well done and unique in both character backgrounds and progressing story. <strong>Recommended for:</strong> I recommend this manga for fans of the One-Punch Man manga and anime. The main character is both witty and strong and the side characters are well made and all have unique personalities.</span></p>

 <p><span style="color: #00ccff;">In this world, the concept of levels exist. Other than those who live off defeating monsters, most people are only around level 1 to 5. What's more, not just anyone can go out to hunt monsters; it's heavily influenced by one's role appointed by God. There are eight such eligible roles. Warriors. Fighters. Clerics. Magicians. Rogues. Merchants. Hunters. Sorcerers. Those blessed with extraordinary power are divided into three types. Royalty. Heroes. Sages. But for the majority of the population, they have no such powers and live by farming or running shops. Towns are developed by those with the weakest role... Villagers. For the powerless Villagers going out to hunt monsters is equivalent to committing suicide. But one day, a certain two-year-old child given the role of Villager notices something. Once you defeat a monster... you can earn great wealth. <strong>Art:</strong> 9/10 The art is pretty good and has fully flushed out backgrounds and everything but is not colored. <strong>Plot:</strong> 10/10 The plot in LV999 Villager is truly unique and also has many uncommon characters. There is no complaints in my book.</span></p>
  <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #00ccff;">I Was A Sword When I Reincarnated</span></h2>
  <h3><span style="color: #00ccff;">Overall rating: 9.25 </span></h3>

  <p><span style="color: #00ccff;">Your kind of isekai manga, but this time he reincarnated as a sword. Following his instinct as a living sword, he traveled to find the one who could be his weilder, until he met with a cat girl who was being attacked by a monster. <strong>Art:</strong> 9/10 the art in the manga is overall pretty good but is also uncolored. <strong>Plot:</strong> 9.5/10 The plot of "I Was A Sword When I Reincarnated" is definitely unique and has a well written storyline and world.</span></p>
