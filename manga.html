  <h3><span style="color: #00ccff;">I recommend Solo Leveling but that was done on a previous website so it wont be reviewed on here.</span></h3>
  <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #00ccff;">Hero? I Quit a Long Time Ago...</span></h2>
  <h3><span style="color: #00ccff;">Overall rating: 9.5/10 </span></h3>

  <p><span style="color: #00ccff;">Zero was mankind's first real superhero. Under his watch, countless other superheroes appeared and followed in his footsteps. However, after 5 years of war, Zero dissapeared without a trace. <strong>Art:</strong> 9.5/10 the art in "Hero? I Quit a Long Time Ago..." is very well done in the fact that it is well drawn, fully colored, and has no blank backgrounds. <strong>Plot:</strong> 9.5/10 The plot in "Hero? I Quit a Long Time Ago..." is pretty well done and unique in both character backgrounds and progressing story. <strong>Recommended for:</strong> I recommend this manga for fans of the One-Punch Man manga and anime. The main character is both witty and strong and the side characters are well made and all have unique personalities.</span></p>
