    <p>Demon Slayer is an anime about a young teen boy named Tanjiro whose parents are killed by a demon so he leaves on a quest for revenge. And to make matters worse his sister is turned into a demon and he needs to research for ways to make her human again. <strong>Fight Scene animation:</strong>9.5/10 impressive for the most part. <strong>General animation</strong> 8.5/10 the animation between fights / important plot hooks is pretty good but it kind of annoys me when for like a 10 second clip now and then they change animation style to the digitally made 3d animation. otherwise pretty good.  <strong>Overall plot</strong> 9/10 pretty generic on the fact that his family gets killed, but unique on the fact that his sister turns into a demon and the different people that he meets on his journey.</p>
