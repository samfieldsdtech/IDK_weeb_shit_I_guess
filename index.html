<h3>Overall rating:9.2/10</h3>

    <p>Demon Slayer is an anime about a young teen boy named Tanjiro whose family is killed by a demon so he leaves on a quest for revenge. And to make matters worse his sister is turned into a demon and he needs to research for ways to make her human again. <strong>Fight Scene animation:</strong> 9.5/10 impressive for the most part. <strong>General animation:</strong> 9/10 the animation between fights / important plot hooks is really good but it kind of annoys me when for like a 10 second clip now and then they change animation style to the digitally made 3d animation. otherwise pretty good. <strong>Overall Plot:</strong> 9/10 pretty generic on the fact that his family gets killed, but unique on the fact that his sister turns into a demon and the different people that he meets on his journey. <strong>Recommended for:</strong> I reccomend this anime for fans of the anime The Rising of the Shield Hero, and other high combat and supernatural anime. This anime is not recommended for people who hate fighting and blood, as there is lots of both, but the anime doesn't dabble as much into detailing the blood like Tokyo Ghoul.</p>
    
    <h2>YU-NO: A Girl Who Chants Love at the Bound of This World</h2>
<h3>Overall rating:9/10</h3>

    <p>The main character, Takuya Arima, receives a package from his missing father in which holds details on the existence of parallel universes and a device that allows him to cross them. He then has to bend time and fate to unravel the mystery of his fathers wherabouts and reveal the secrets of those around him. <strong>Overall Plot:</strong> 9.5/10 this anime has many mysteries and is basically all plot. The plot overall is pretty interesting and has you thinking at the end of the episode "Well shit, that just happened." <strong>Animation:</strong> 8.5/10 the animation is decent but nothing really too special. <strong>Recommended for:</strong> I recommend this anime for fans of the Stein's Gate series, which is to say that the anime is good at making you as the viewer think and try to figure out what will happen next. May not be recommended for people who have trouble following many things at once, or are just looking for an easy anime to watch.</p>
    
    <h2>One-Punch Man Season Two</h2>
<h3>Overall Rating: 9/10</h3>

<p>Saitama just wants to chill and fight bad guys occasionally but when a powerful villan who calls himself a monster disrupts the peace he has to put him in his place. <strong>Comparison to previous season:</strong> One-Punch Man Season Two has got a lot of shit for not being as good as the previous season, but J.C. Staff have been doing a pretty good job in animating it. The second season is definitely worthwhile watching though because of multiple reasons, one of which being that it has significantly more plot that the first season, and two being that it does actually have good animation, just not as good as the first season because it was produced by a different studio. <strong>Plot:</strong> 9.5/10 One-Punch Man Season Two has much more consistant plot than the previous season, mostly because around that time the author decided to start doing the manga for real. <strong>Animation:</strong> 8.5/10 The animation of the second season has been pretty satisfactory overall, but considering the first season it does put a damper on viewing the animation. <strong>Recommended for:</strong> I recommend One-Punch Man Season Two to mostly all people. The show covers the genres of both action and comedy pretty well and also has a serious side every once in a while.</p>
